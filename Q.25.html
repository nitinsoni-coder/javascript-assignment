BMI is used to broadly define different weight groups in adults 20 years old or older.Check if a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese based the information given below.
    - The same groups apply to both men and women.
    - Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
    - Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
    - Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    - Obese: BMI is 30 or more
